<h1>Project Status</h1>
I started coding of my character with a pre-refined walk cycle. I wanted to test some code to see how far I could get. So far I have just used a key up and down handler to get the character walking from left to right. The key down handlers are assigned to the left arrow key to move left and right arrow key to walk right. The up handler allows the character to stop an whatever frame it is currently playing when either key is released. I have the character stopping on the frame as I have not animated a turning cycle to play when he comes to a stop. I didn't run into any issues while coding the keyboard events but some issues did occur when converting the animation to a symbol. At first when i lifted the key the character would reset back to the center of the stage and give an error.I got the same error when the character reached the end of the stage. In the end i copied all the frames and the character on to a new file with a blank stage and converted it to a symbol, this fixed the issues i had with the errors.
